# / ASP.net (MVC is ok but if can avoid that it would be helpful) Remember no Linq.

Create a webform for data input/output

EmployeeID - Unique ID
EmployeeLastName
EmployeeFirstName
EmployeePhone formatted (XXX) XXX-XXXX
EmployeeZip
HireDate formatted as MM/DD/YYYY

Display data sorted ascending by date

Extra points – search screen where you can enter either EmployeeLastName or EmployeePhone and it returns all 6 fields

#specifically demonstrate:

- ASP.NET C# / JavaScript code that shows SQL connectivity. MVC would be acceptable as a second option.
 
- Ideally the sample has been implemented using n-tier architecture, showing a clear separation of the layers. We are looking for good coding practices.
 
- If the code can show native SQL, versus relying on LINQ for database access, that would be preferable. We want to ensure a knowledge of SQL exists.
 
- Code showing AJAX use would earn extra points.
 
- We leverage Telerik RadControls at AireSpring – Bonus points could be earned by code showing this.
